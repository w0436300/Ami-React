Content Generator Evaluation — LLM-as-a-Judge

For each scenario, runs the unified content generation pipeline via:
  - generate-learning-content

This mirrors exactly what the frontend knowledge_document.py does in
render_content_preparation() for both the baseline (GenMentor) and the
enhanced (5902Group5) versions.  The assembled document and quizzes are
then judged on shared and enhanced-only dimensions.

Scoring rubric — higher is always better:
- cognitive_level_match: Does the content complexity match the learner's stated background?
    Score 5: explanations and examples are pitched at exactly the right level — neither over-simplified for an experienced learner nor assuming knowledge a beginner does not have.
    Score 4: level match is strong overall, with only minor moments that are slightly too advanced or too basic.
    Score 3: level match is mixed — substantial parts fit, but noticeable sections are mismatched for the learner.
    Score 2: level match is weak — much of the content is inappropriately advanced or simplistic, with only limited useful sections.
    Score 1: the content is severely mismatched — either far too advanced (assumes expertise the learner clearly lacks) or far too basic (condescendingly simple for a learner with stated experience).
- factual_accuracy: Are the claims made in the content correct?
    Score 5: all statements are factually accurate with no misleading simplifications or errors.
    Score 4: content is mostly accurate; any inaccuracies are minor and unlikely to mislead the learner's core understanding.
    Score 3: accuracy is mixed; there are some meaningful errors or oversimplifications, but key ideas are still partly correct.
    Score 2: accuracy is poor; multiple significant errors or misleading claims affect important concepts.
    Score 1: the content contains clear factual errors or significantly misleading statements that would cause the learner to form incorrect understanding.
- quiz_alignment: Do the quiz questions test concepts that were actually explained in this session's content?
    Score 5: every quiz question directly tests a concept or skill that was covered and explained in the content excerpt for this session.
    Score 4: most quiz questions align with explained concepts, with at most one minor drift into lightly covered material.
    Score 3: partial alignment; some questions are relevant, but several target concepts not clearly taught in the content.
    Score 2: weak alignment; most questions are loosely related or rely on concepts not properly explained.
    Score 1: the quiz questions ask about topics not covered in the content, or are entirely disconnected from the session's stated knowledge points.
- engagement_quality: Is the content clearly structured, well-explained, and supported by concrete examples?
    Score 5: the content has a logical flow, uses concrete examples to illustrate concepts, and is written in an accessible way that would motivate a learner to continue.
    Score 4: content is generally clear and engaging, with good structure and some concrete examples, though a few sections are less polished.
    Score 3: engagement is inconsistent; structure or clarity is adequate in parts, but explanations or examples are uneven.
    Score 2: content is hard to follow for long stretches, with weak structure and few useful examples.
    Score 1: the content is disorganised or relies on unexplained jargon, lacks any illustrative examples, or is written in a way that would actively discourage a learner.

Important: verify that your score and reason are consistent before writing the JSON.
A positive reason (e.g., "content well-matched", "all questions aligned") must map to a HIGH score (4 or 5).
A negative reason (e.g., "factual errors present", "quiz unrelated to content") must map to a LOW score (1 or 2)."""

Also evaluate these two enhanced-only dimensions and merge them into the same JSON object:
FSLSM Dimensions: {fslsm_dimensions}
(Scale: -1.0 to +1.0; processing: -1=active, +1=reflective; perception: -1=sensing, +1=intuitive;
 input: -1=visual, +1=verbal; understanding: -1=sequential, +1=global)

{{
  "fslsm_content_adaptation": {{"score": <int 1-5>, "reason": "<one sentence>"}},
  "solo_cognitive_alignment": {{"score": <int 1-5>, "reason": "<one sentence>"}}
}}

FSLSM content adaptation — check whether the content format reflects the learner's style preferences:
- Visual learner (input ≤ -0.5): content should include diagrams, tables, or visual examples
- Verbal learner (input ≥ 0.5): content should use text-heavy narrative explanations
- Active learner (processing ≤ -0.5): content should include hands-on exercises, code challenges, or interactive tasks
- Reflective learner (processing ≥ 0.5): content should include reflection prompts, analysis tasks, or compare-and-contrast sections
- Sensing learner (perception ≤ -0.5): concrete examples should appear before abstract concepts
- Intuitive learner (perception ≥ 0.5): theory and concepts should appear before concrete examples
- Balanced learner (all dimensions near 0.0): any well-structured mixed approach is acceptable

- fslsm_content_adaptation:
    Score 5: the content format clearly reflects the learner's FSLSM profile (e.g., a visual learner's content includes visual elements; an active learner's content includes exercises), or the learner is balanced and the content is well-structured overall.
    Score 4: adaptation is mostly aligned with FSLSM preferences, with only minor omissions in one dimension.
    Score 3: adaptation is partial — some style preferences are reflected, but others are missing or weakly implemented.
    Score 2: adaptation is limited — most FSLSM preferences are not reflected, with only occasional accidental alignment.
    Score 1: the content format directly contradicts the FSLSM profile (e.g., a visual learner receives pure text with no visual elements; an active learner receives only passive reading with no tasks).

SOLO cognitive alignment — does the content's cognitive demand match the learner's current level?
- unlearned / beginner (unistructural): simple definitions, one concept at a time, abundant concrete examples
- intermediate (multistructural): multiple concepts covered side-by-side, comparisons, structured lists
- advanced (relational): integration of concepts, cause-effect reasoning, applying knowledge to realistic scenarios
- expert (extended abstract): generalisation, critical evaluation, novel problem-solving beyond taught examples

- solo_cognitive_alignment:
    Score 5: the content's depth, complexity, and cognitive tasks closely match the learner's current SOLO level (e.g., a beginner receives clear definitions and simple examples; an advanced learner receives integration and application tasks).
    Score 4: cognitive demand is mostly appropriate, with minor over- or under-shooting in a few sections.
    Score 3: cognitive demand is uneven — some sections match SOLO level well, while others are noticeably miscalibrated.
    Score 2: cognitive demand is largely misaligned, with only limited portions matching the learner's SOLO level.
    Score 1: the content is dramatically misaligned with the current SOLO level (e.g., abstract critical evaluation tasks for a total beginner, or trivially simple definitions for a learner already at an advanced level).
