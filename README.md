  <p>A cognitive-style adaptive AI tutor — an enhanced fork of GenMentor (WWW 2025)</p>
</div>

---

## Overview

This repository is a fork of [GenMentor](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15749) (WWW 2025, Industry Track). Ami extends the original goal-oriented tutoring direction with explicit orchestration layers for quality control, reflexion pipelines, and production-style backend/frontend integration.

The system is grounded in two pedagogical frameworks:

- **Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM)**: characterizes each learner across four dimensions (active/reflective, sensing/intuitive, visual/verbal, sequential/global) to drive content format and presentation
- **SOLO Taxonomy**: classifies cognitive complexity across five levels (pre-structural → extended abstract) to calibrate content difficulty and quiz depth

Problem: adaptive tutoring systems typically collapse content planning, skill-gap detection, and response generation into a single pass. Ami introduces tighter control loops — parse/critique/refine steps, quality evaluators, targeted repair, ethics/bias auditing, and request-time tool routing — to improve reliability and personalization.

This repo contains:
- `backend/`: FastAPI backend (auth, goals/profiles, reflexion pipelines, content generation with quality gates, session runtime, analytics, session prefetch)
- `frontend/`: Streamlit frontend (auth-gated onboarding, skill-gap and plan flows, learning content sessioning, profile, dashboard) — a React SPA is under active development for the Beta release

## Ami Enhancements

### 1. Skill Gap Reflexion + Bias Auditing

- **Loop 1 (goal clarification)**: `GoalContextParser ↔ LearningGoalRefiner`
- **Loop 2 (skill-gap critique/refinement)**: `SkillGapIdentifier ↔ SkillGapEvaluator`
- **Post-loop audit (always run)**: `BiasAuditor` checks for demographic or confidence-level bias in skill gap assumptions

Implemented in `identify_skill_gap_with_llm`. Separates goal-specific refinement from skill-gap quality evaluation, with bias auditing as a mandatory gate.

Bias and ethics auditing extends across all major surfaces of the system:

| Surface | Agent | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| Skill gap | `BiasAuditor` | Demographic or confidence-level bias in gap assumptions |
| Learner profile | `FairnessValidator` | Stereotyping or demographic bias in profile construction |
| Generated content | `ContentBiasAuditor` | Exclusionary framing, inappropriate language, or demographic bias in lesson material |
| Chatbot responses | `ChatbotBiasAuditor` | Bias or inappropriate content in tutor replies |

### 2. Learning Plan Reflexion

- Initial schedule generation (`LearningPathScheduler.schedule_session`)
- Plan quality simulation via embedded feedback simulator (integrated into the plan pipeline, not a separate module)
- Reflexion pass(es) using evaluator directives (`LearningPathScheduler.reflexion`)

Implemented by `schedule_learning_path_agentic` with bounded refinement iterations.

### 3. Content Generation Quality Pipeline

The orchestrator runs a staged pipeline with two embedded reflexion loops:

`explore → draft → [deterministic + LLM draft checkpoints] → targeted draft repair → integrate → final quality checkpoint → targeted repair / fallback`

- **Draft reflexion loop**: `KnowledgeDraftEvaluator` evaluates each knowledge point draft; failed sections are repaired before integration
- **Integration reflexion loop**: `IntegratedDocumentEvaluator` evaluates the full document; targeted repair (`integrator_only` or `section_redraft`) runs on failure, with a fallback path when the quality budget is exhausted
- FSLSM-aware content adaptation (`fslsm_adaptation.py`) tailors format per learner style
- Multi-modal enrichment: TTS audio generation, media search (videos/diagrams/podcasts), ASCII diagram rendering

Implemented in `generate_learning_content_with_llm` in `modules/content_generator/`.

### 4. Tutor Tool-Fetching Architecture

Ami (the chatbot tutor) assembles tools at request time based on per-request toggles:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `retrieve_session_learning_content` | Access current session's learning document for context-aware answers |
| `retrieve_vector_context` | Verified-content RAG retrieval from indexed course materials |
| `search_web_context_ephemeral` | Ephemeral web search (non-persistent) |
| `search_media_resources` | Search and filter media resources (video, diagram, podcast) |
| `update_learning_preferences_from_signal` | Signal-gated FSLSM profile updates from tutoring interactions |

Implemented through `AITutorChatbot._build_runtime_tools` and `create_ai_tutor_tools`.

### 5. Adaptive Learner Profile Updates

The learner profile is not static after onboarding — it evolves throughout the learning lifecycle through three update channels:

- **Manual edit**: The learner explicitly adjusts FSLSM dimensions via sliders (`update_learning_preferences_with_llm` → `/update-learning-preferences`) or updates background/bio via text and optional resume re-upload (`update_learner_information_with_llm` → `/update-learner-information`). These two paths are scoped separately to prevent unintended cross-field changes.
- **Quiz-driven cognitive progression**: Mastery evaluation outcomes drive `update_cognitive_status_with_llm`, tracking SOLO level advancement session-over-session.
- **Chatbot signal-gated updates**: When Ami detects a strong learning preference signal during tutoring (e.g., "I prefer visual explanations"), the `update_learning_preferences_from_signal` tool applies a preference update — but only when signal confidence and user/goal context are both present.

Implemented in `AdaptiveLearningProfiler` (`modules/learner_profiler/`) and the chatbot tool `update_learning_preferences_from_signal`.

### 6. Session Prefetch

`ContentPrefetchService` (`services/content_prefetch.py`) prefetches upcoming learning sessions in the background while a learner works through their current session. This reduces wait time at session transitions without blocking the current session flow.
