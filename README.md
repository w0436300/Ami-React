  <p><b>Cognitive-Style Adaptive AI Tutor</b></p>
  <p>An enhanced fork of GenMentor — LLM-powered & Goal-oriented Tutoring System</p>
</div>

---

## Overview

This repository is a **fork of [GenMentor](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15749)** (WWW 2025, Industry Track — Oral Presentation), an LLM-powered multi-agent framework for goal-oriented learning in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). Our group is building upon GenMentor to create a **Cognitive-Style Adaptive AI Tutor** that delivers truly personalized learning experiences. We are calling this enhanced fork Ami: Adaptive Mentoring Intelligence system.

Modern digital education often adopts a "one-size-fits-all" approach, failing to account for the diverse cognitive needs of individual learners. Students, professionals, and lifelong learners frequently struggle with content that is either too complex for their current knowledge level or presented in a format that does not align with their unique cognitive styles. This leads to disengagement, fragmented learning progress, and time wasted on inefficient study methods.

Our project addresses this gap by enhancing GenMentor with:

- **Verified educational content** as the source for content generation (via RAG and web search)
- **Pedagogically-grounded learner profiling** based on the Felder-Silverman learning styles model and the SOLO Taxonomy
- **More granular evaluation of students** through improved assessment mechanisms
- **A React-based frontend** being developed in parallel for a responsive, accessible user experience, while this repository maintains a Streamlit frontend as an alternative

## Key Improvements Over GenMentor

| Area | Original GenMentor | Ami |
|---|---|---|
| Content Sources | LLM-generated only | Verified materials via RAG + web search |
| Learner Profiling | Basic profile | Grounded in Felder-Silverman & SOLO Taxonomy |
| Student Evaluation | Coarse assessment | More granular, rubric-based evaluation |
| Frontend | Streamlit | React SPA (in parallel development) + Streamlit alternative maintained in this repository |
| Learner Simulation | N/A | Learner simulator agent for content quality feedback loop |

### Agent Modules

1. **Learner Profiler** — Determines the learner's cognitive ability and learning preferences using attributes based on pedagogical studies (Felder-Silverman model), giving the system a holistic view of how each learner most effectively learns.

2. **Skill Gap Identifier** — Analyzes the gap between what the learner wants to learn and their current skills, enabling targeted learning paths and materials.

3. **Learning Plan Generator** — Generates a personalized learning plan that continuously adjusts based on the student's progress and difficulty level.

4. **Content Generator and Evaluator** — Generates personalized content and assessments tailored to learner preferences. Decides whether to source content from verified materials (via RAG) or web search.

5. **Learner Simulator** — Simulates the student to evaluate the quality of learning paths and content, creating a feedback loop for continuous improvement.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, LangChain, OpenAI/Google/Meta LLMs
- **Frontend**: React (in parallel development), Streamlit (maintained alternative in this repository)
- **Content Retrieval**: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) via LangChain vector stores
- **Evaluation**: RAGAS for the assessment of the RAG system and LLM-as-a-judge for the evaluation of the agents
- **Design**: Figma for prototyping and design system

## Project Context

This project is developed as part of **GNG 5902 (Winter 2026)** at the University of Ottawa.

- **Client**: Dr. Ali Abbas — CEO of Smart Digital Medicine, Adjunct Professor at uOttawa
- **Technical Advisor**: Prof. Ismaeel Al-Ridhawi — Associate Professor, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, uOttawa

## Getting Started

For setup and usage instructions, see the respective directories:

- [`backend/`](backend/) — Backend installation, configuration, and running instructions
- [`frontend/`](frontend/) — Frontend installation, configuration, and running instructions

### Deploying React frontend to GitHub Pages

The React app in `frontend-react/` can be published to GitHub Pages so the site is available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

1. **Enable GitHub Pages (one-time)**  
   In your repo: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source** → choose **GitHub Actions**.

2. **Push to trigger deploy**  
   Push to the `main` branch (or run the workflow manually: **Actions → Deploy to GitHub Pages → Run workflow**). The workflow builds `frontend-react` and deploys the `dist` output.

3. **If your default branch is not `main`**  
   Edit [`.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml) and change `branches: [main]` to your branch (e.g. `master`).

4. **Local build for testing**  
   From repo root:  
   `cd frontend-react && BASE_PATH=/Ami-React/ npm run build`  
   Then open `frontend-react/dist/index.html` or use `npx serve frontend-react/dist -p 4173` and visit `http://localhost:4173/Ami-React/`.
