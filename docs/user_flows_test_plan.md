# Ami — User Flows, Backend Tests & Frontend Verification Plan

> **Purpose:** This document lists each user flow's **user story**, the **backend test script** that covers it, and the **frontend test steps** to manually verify the flow end-to-end.
>
> **Prerequisites for most flows:** Log in or register (see Flow 1). Complete onboarding by selecting a persona, entering a learning goal, and clicking "Begin Learning" (see Flow 2). These setup steps are not repeated in every flow.

> **I want** the system to detect these changes and suggest adapting my learning path,
> **so that** my plan stays aligned with my evolving needs while preserving the progress I've already made.

### Backend Test Scripts

| Test file | Class / Tests | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| `test_plan_regeneration.py` | `TestComputeFSLSMDeltas` (2 tests) | FSLSM delta computation, handles missing dimensions |
| `test_plan_regeneration.py` | `TestCountMasteryFailures` (2 tests) | Mastery failure counting, empty results |
| `test_plan_regeneration.py` | `TestDecideRegeneration` (9 tests) | Decision logic: keep (delta < 0.3), adjust_future (delta in [0.3, 0.5) or single mastery failure), regenerate (delta >= 0.5 or sign flip or multiple failures), preserves learned sessions |

**Run command:**
```bash
python -m pytest backend/tests/test_plan_regeneration.py -v
```

### Streamlit Frontend Test Steps

#### 9.1 — Adaptation decision scenarios

> Test all three decision outcomes by varying the triggering condition.

| Scenario | Trigger | Expected Decision |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Minor preference change (delta < 0.3) | Small FSLSM tweak within same persona | **KEEP** — "Your current plan is still on track." No changes made |
| Moderate preference change (delta 0.3–0.5) | Moderate FSLSM shift on one dimension | **ADJUST_FUTURE** — Future sessions adjusted. Shows which sessions affected |
| Major preference change (delta >= 0.5 or sign flip) | Switch from "Hands-on Explorer" to "Conceptual Thinker" | **REGENERATE** — Plan regenerated. Full reasoning shown |
| Single mastery failure | Score significantly below threshold (e.g., 30% vs 70%) | **ADJUST_FUTURE** — Future sessions adjusted to reinforce weak areas |

For each scenario:

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Trigger the condition (preference change or mastery failure) | Adaptation banner appears on Learning Path page with **"Adapt Learning Path"** button |
| 2 | Click **"Adapt Learning Path"** | Spinner while processing. Decision and reasoning displayed |
| 3 | Verify learned sessions preserved (if REGENERATE) | Previously completed sessions retain "learned" status, mastery scores, and content. Only unlearned sessions change |

## Flow 10 — Cross-Goal Profile Sync

### User Story

> **As a** learner with multiple learning goals,
> **I want** my mastered skills and learning preferences to carry across all goals,
> **so that** new goals recognize what I already know and my learning style is consistent.

### Backend Test Scripts

| Test file | Class / Tests | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| `test_profile_sync.py` | `TestMergeSharedProfileFields` (8 tests) | Mastered skills union (highest proficiency wins), FSLSM propagation, behavioral patterns propagation, in_progress cleanup, overall_progress recalculation, persistence, no-op when single goal |

**Run command:**
```bash
python -m pytest backend/tests/test_profile_sync.py -v
```

### Streamlit Frontend Test Steps

#### 10.1 — New goal inherits mastered skills

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Complete onboarding for Goal A (e.g., "Learn Python"). Complete sessions until a skill is mastered | Skill appears in mastered_skills on My Profile |
| 2 | Create a new Goal B (e.g., "Learn Kubernetes") | Onboarding flow starts |

| 4 | Click "Schedule Learning Path" | Profile is created and synced |
| 5 | Navigate to My Profile for Goal B | Mastered skills from Goal A appear in Goal B's mastered_skills list |

#### 10.2 — FSLSM preferences shared across goals

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | On Goal A's My Profile, update preferences (e.g., "I prefer visual learning") | FSLSM dimensions update |
| 2 | Switch to Goal B via the goal selector | Goal B becomes active |
| 3 | Navigate to My Profile for Goal B | Same FSLSM dimension values as Goal A |

#### 10.3 — Goal switch syncs mastered skills

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | With two active goals, complete a session in Goal A that masters a skill | Skill moves to mastered_skills in Goal A |
| 2 | Switch to Goal B | Profile sync runs |
| 3 | Navigate to My Profile for Goal B | Newly mastered skill from Goal A appears. If Goal B had the same skill in in_progress, it's now gone |

#### 10.4 — First goal (no other goals to sync from)

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Fresh user, create first goal | Profile is created normally. No errors from sync |

### Notes for the Team

1. **API endpoint tests** (`test_auth_api.py`, `test_onboarding_api.py`) require the full backend dependency stack (langchain, etc.) because they import `from main import app`. Run these in the dev environment with all backend dependencies installed.

2. **LLM-dependent endpoint tests** (`test_onboarding_api.py`) use **mocked LLM functions** — they do NOT call real LLM APIs. This means they test the endpoint contract (request/response shapes, error handling, store persistence) without needing API keys.

3. **Integration tests** (`test_fslsm_update.py`) call real LLMs and require an OpenAI API key configured in the environment.

4. **Frontend tests** are manual — Streamlit does not have a built-in automated testing framework. Follow the step-by-step tables above, checking each expected result. Document any deviations as bugs.

5. **Configuration endpoints** — The backend exposes two read-only configuration endpoints that the frontend (Streamlit or React) fetches at startup. These do not require authentication:
   - `GET /personas` — Returns the learning persona definitions (names, descriptions, FSLSM dimension values).
   - `GET /config` — Returns application configuration: skill levels, default session count, default LLM type/method, FSLSM threshold values and labels, motivational trigger interval, and max refinement iterations. The frontend falls back to local defaults if the backend is unreachable.
